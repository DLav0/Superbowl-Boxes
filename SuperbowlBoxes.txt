I initialized a react app using npx create-react-app nucampsite --template redux command.  I figured Redux will be useful down the 
line.  I installed the same dependancies as the 2024 nucampsite.  I am following that example to create this app.

The current plan is to first just render both the chart with the 100 boxes and a default set of names to pass in as data.
After that point, it should prompt the user with a form to enter new people and assign each person a random box until all the
boxes have been filled.  Also an option to view all of the entries and edit if desired.  

For now, it is framed as each person has an object with name, shortname, and email in addition to a randomly assigned combo
of AFC and NFC.  I'm not sure if this will change to simplify the process of entering info, and rendering to the chart.

The chart may either consist of 100 box components.  Components of 10 boxes forming a row.  10 row components.  Or if
there is some kind of chart component I can add.  This part will likely not be explained in nucampsite.  

Now I am just poking around and setting up a github repository.  

Make the Redux page a component that can be acessed for experimental purposes.  Replace the App return with a rendering of 
the default persons including all the info from their object.  probably need to push each person to an array of objects for React 
to iterate.  

Probably will use the react-router-dom to switch between pages.  Start with a list on one page.

I basically rendered the initial Redux page with a header above it with the text "Superbowl Boxes Pool".  I made the Redux return 
into it's own component and removed the <header> div.  Then modified App.js to include the new header with the ReduxInit component
beneath it.  Git commit "Redux Component".
