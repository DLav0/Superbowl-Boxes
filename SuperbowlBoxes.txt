I initialized a react app using npx create-react-app nucampsite --template redux command.  I figured Redux will be useful down the 
line.  I installed the same dependancies as the 2024 nucampsite.  I am following that example to create this app.

The current plan is to first just render both the chart with the 100 boxes and a default set of names to pass in as data.
After that point, it should prompt the user with a form to enter new people and assign each person a random box until all the
boxes have been filled.  Also an option to view all of the entries and edit if desired.  

For now, it is framed as each person has an object with name, shortname, and email in addition to a randomly assigned combo
of AFC and NFC.  I'm not sure if this will change to simplify the process of entering info, and rendering to the chart.

The chart may either consist of 100 box components.  Components of 10 boxes forming a row.  10 row components.  Or if
there is some kind of chart component I can add.  This part will likely not be explained in nucampsite.  

Now I am just poking around and setting up a github repository.  

Make the Redux page a component that can be acessed for experimental purposes.  Replace the App return with a rendering of 
the default persons including all the info from their object.  probably need to push each person to an array of objects for React 
to iterate.  

Probably will use the react-router-dom to switch between pages.  Start with a list on one page.

I basically rendered the initial Redux page with a header above it with the text "Superbowl Boxes Pool".  I made the Redux return 
into it's own component and removed the <header> div.  Then modified App.js to include the new header with the ReduxInit component
beneath it.  Git commit "Redux Component".

I think the easy part is done.  Need to set up interactivity to add people to the list.  I'll just have a form on the front page.
Worry about styling later.  I guess first get the state redifined.  Just keep in mind that refresing the page will reset evertything.

I read through the default Redux Counter App.  Seems confusing.  Need to update the state of the persons array with a form input.
initialize with the dummies I created by default.  Add to the array grabbing a random combo without changing the numbers of the people
already on the list.  It's not going to change an array in javascript.  I'm not really sure how to do this with Redux.  I could probably 
use a push command on a js object, but that's not going to work with the React State Parameters.

The other thing is to figure out how to make the chart and display the shortnames based on the person's numbers.

I'd like to get to the point where I can enter an entry, one at a time.  Then view each entry and have a button next to it to edit.
Then some kind of modal to re enter the info.  And editing the person's info does not change the numbers.  So I guess each combo is 
randomly assigned, but does not change as people are added and edtited.  Or enter all one hundred names before assigning the combos.
That may be more desireable.

Set up a page router and a link.  If I put '/list' into the Chrome address bar, the numbers randomize.  I guess the randomBox script is
called again.  Also randomizes if I refresh the page.  If I use the link set up using the <Link> component, the numbers do not refresh.
I think at this point, the person objects are in the same state.  Note, using back and forward in the browser will reset the state if
the route was typed in directly, but will not if the link was used.  Was this the way in worked in Pizza Portfolio?

Not really sure how to do the styling on the list page.  I'd like them in the same box, but text justified to the left like it was before.

I removed the React import from App.js and it seems to work.  This import is not in App.js in i-heart-react or nucampsite 2024

Click on any name in the list, open a modal with the persons info, have an option to change the name, shortname, or email.  

I got it to justify the text as before.  If more pages are added, the App-header class can not surround everything.  I'll have to 
figure out the styling.  Seems not as easy as just bootstrap.

Tried to make a form to input info.  Having difficulty installing react-redux-form in this project.  I may just have to continue 
and use formic or something.  I just want to enter a name, email, and shortname with validators.  then have the input change the state
by adding a new object to the persons array.

Going to follow the new Nucamp project to add in a form that accepts the inputs I am looking for.  This submitted data needs to 
somehow be made into an object and assigned one of the combos.  Not sure about how this needs to be done in React.  I doubt the
JS I wrote will do all that.  

I used formik to make a small form to input information.  Having difficulty styling the input form to my desire.  Maybe worry about
that later?  

The styling issue was because I did not import Bootstrap in index.js.  The styling is decent enough.  Added validation to the formik
form.  

Need to select people from list and bring up a modal to edit info without changing the numbers.  First figure how to assign random 
combos and update the list as the user enters them in the form.  Then figure out the boxes page.
