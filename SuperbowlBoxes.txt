I initialized a react app using npx create-react-app nucampsite --template redux command.  I figured Redux will be useful down the 
line.  I installed the same dependancies as the 2024 nucampsite.  I am following that example to create this app.

The current plan is to first just render both the chart with the 100 boxes and a default set of names to pass in as data.
After that point, it should prompt the user with a form to enter new people and assign each person a random box until all the
boxes have been filled.  Also an option to view all of the entries and edit if desired.  

For now, it is framed as each person has an object with name, shortname, and email in addition to a randomly assigned combo
of AFC and NFC.  I'm not sure if this will change to simplify the process of entering info, and rendering to the chart.

The chart may either consist of 100 box components.  Components of 10 boxes forming a row.  10 row components.  Or if
there is some kind of chart component I can add.  This part will likely not be explained in nucampsite.  

Now I am just poking around and setting up a github repository.  

Make the Redux page a component that can be acessed for experimental purposes.  Replace the App return with a rendering of 
the default persons including all the info from their object.  probably need to push each person to an array of objects for React 
to iterate.  

Probably will use the react-router-dom to switch between pages.  Start with a list on one page.

Wed, Feb 7, 2024

I basically rendered the initial Redux page with a header above it with the text "Superbowl Boxes Pool".  I made the Redux return 
into it's own component and removed the <header> div.  Then modified App.js to include the new header with the ReduxInit component
beneath it.  Git commit "Redux Component".

I think the easy part is done.  Need to set up interactivity to add people to the list.  I'll just have a form on the front page.
Worry about styling later.  I guess first get the state redifined.  Just keep in mind that refresing the page will reset evertything.

I read through the default Redux Counter App.  Seems confusing.  Need to update the state of the persons array with a form input.
initialize with the dummies I created by default.  Add to the array grabbing a random combo without changing the numbers of the people
already on the list.  It's not going to change an array in javascript.  I'm not really sure how to do this with Redux.  I could probably 
use a push command on a js object, but that's not going to work with the React State Parameters.

The other thing is to figure out how to make the chart and display the shortnames based on the person's numbers.

I'd like to get to the point where I can enter an entry, one at a time.  Then view each entry and have a button next to it to edit.
Then some kind of modal to re enter the info.  And editing the person's info does not change the numbers.  So I guess each combo is 
randomly assigned, but does not change as people are added and edtited.  Or enter all one hundred names before assigning the combos.
That may be more desireable.

Set up a page router and a link.  If I put '/list' into the Chrome address bar, the numbers randomize.  I guess the randomBox script is
called again.  Also randomizes if I refresh the page.  If I use the link set up using the <Link> component, the numbers do not refresh.
I think at this point, the person objects are in the same state.  Note, using back and forward in the browser will reset the state if
the route was typed in directly, but will not if the link was used.  Was this the way in worked in Pizza Portfolio?

Not really sure how to do the styling on the list page.  I'd like them in the same box, but text justified to the left like it was before.

I removed the React import from App.js and it seems to work.  This import is not in App.js in i-heart-react or nucampsite 2024

Click on any name in the list, open a modal with the persons info, have an option to change the name, shortname, or email.  

I got it to justify the text as before.  If more pages are added, the App-header class can not surround everything.  I'll have to 
figure out the styling.  Seems not as easy as just bootstrap.

Tried to make a form to input info.  Having difficulty installing react-redux-form in this project.  I may just have to continue 
and use formic or something.  I just want to enter a name, email, and shortname with validators.  then have the input change the state
by adding a new object to the persons array.  

Tues, Feb 13, 2024

Going to follow the new Nucamp project to add in a form that accepts the inputs I am looking for.  This submitted data needs to 
somehow be made into an object and assigned one of the combos.  Not sure about how this needs to be done in React.  I doubt the
JS I wrote will do all that.  

I used formik to make a small form to input information.  Having difficulty styling the input form to my desire.  Maybe worry about
that later?  

The styling issue was because I did not import Bootstrap in index.js.  The styling is decent enough.  Added validation to the formik
form.  

Need to select people from list and bring up a modal to edit info without changing the numbers.  First figure how to assign random 
combos and update the list as the user enters them in the form.  Then figure out the boxes page.  

Thurs, Feb 15, 2024

I used a state hook and put it in the parent component of the App.  I can now add names to the list, and have them rendered.  It seems
to take a random combination like it is supposed to.

Next I want to get it to invert the order of the list, and assign an id number to each person.  Then set up a link on each person's name 
that can be used to modify their info, without changine their number.  Also consider setting up the boxes on the next page.  

Animation to slide from one page to the next.  

It is working.  I'm not sure about consequenses of using the JS on the randomBox page.  Should the combos be a part of the React state?
All the inputed info is gone if the page refreshes.  Any way to make the system more cheat proof?  Could be an issue for some people.

I could release this online, just as a demonstration.

Error messages could include adding more than 100 people.  Also check for repeat names and emails.  

Could give the option to just enter names, names and short names, or names, shortnames, and email

Fri, Feb 16, 2024

I got the modal to display any person on the list that is clicked on.  I'd like to add a button to this to be able to edit the name and
email, without changing the numbers.  ANother thing to do is to check to verify that a name has not already been added.  Check for repeat 
emails, names, and shortnames.  If the randomBox works correctly, there should be no repeates.  THis may be a good time to try and make the boxes.
follow tick tack toe model?

Sat, Feb 17, 2024

Maybe an option to alphabetize the list of names, if that is possible.  Remove numbers and list alphabetically?  Index for map funciton 
will be backwards based on how the objects are defined.  

Sun, Feb 18, 2024

I got the edit modal to open upon pressing an 'Edit' button in the person card.  Passed values from an input form along with the id of the 
person being editted to the App component.  Need to get app to modify the person without changing the numbers or anyone else's information. 
Also want the edit form to have default entries of the current name, short name, and email.

Diffifulty moddifying the persons state and getting to work.  Looks like in changes the correct object, but somehting is thowing off the map funciton
after the change is made.  Can't really figure out.  Looking at React documentation.  could move on and come back to this feature later.  

May also want to make a remove option.  May want to come back to this later.  What's the best way to handle deletes?  Maybe you can't make
edits without ranomizing the whole thing

Monday, Feb 19, 2024

I had to use a function to copy the filtered object to be editted.  This way, i can manipulate the object without changing the properties in the 
persons array.  It worked, im just trying to only change the array using the change state function from React.  May want to modify the randomBox
thing so I don't have nested objects, and can use the spread operator to do what I want it to.  For now, it uses 

let personY = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(personZ))[0]

Could add a delete feature as well.  Not sure how that would work with combos.  May want to re sctructure the whole thing.  What if it randomizes 
every time an update is made?  That would make it hard to cheat.  Or a way to put in all the names, then randomly assign a square at the end.  
Probably want something to check for repeats on all the inputs.  

Can a map function do the same thing as the JSON.parse?  Idea is to copy the selected object without changing it.  Find a copy of nucampsite on
github?  Would like to have a copy of completed project.  Switch state control to Redux?  Maybe convert Pizza Portfolio.  useReducer hook?

Maybe use the simplified state control to make list app in React Native.

I updated the class component to leave this.both with an empty string.  Now I can use spread syntax to isolate the person to be editd from the 
methods changing the copy.  

Had the idea to basically have the user enter in all the names, review and verify that all the info is correct, then assign the random values to 
each person.  This would deter cheating by seeing a good number and slipping in someones name.  I guess for now I'll just make the boxes like I 
intended.  Need to construct boxes somehow anyway.  

Authentication and memory if the page accidentally gets refresed.  Maybe not scale to have users submit their own info.  That would be complicated.
But the one user could have the feature to save progress, and save the chart.  The chart should be interactive and printable.  

Add a footer?  Got routing for boxes page to work with button on list page.  animation from one page to the next.  

UX Put in all the names.  Once 100 is reached, prompt to be sure to go over all of the names and verify.  Can edit and delete at any point.  figuere 
out how to structure the delete.  Needs to shift id numbers around?  or the next person is assigned the missing number?  When 100 names are input, somehow
a button to view the boxes appears.  boxes should be interactive?  Maybe more important to just have an option to print it out.  or email.
This way, the submit and random assignments are done at the same time to discourage cheating.

Next level would be to actually email each person in the pool with their respective numbers.  Def not sure how to send out 100 emails based on user input.
Would send their numbers, the chart as a link, possibly an option to log into the pool and use the interactive chart to see where their friends and enemies 
are on the chart.  Separate first and last names?  May be a benefit in an alphabetical list.  

Wed, Feb 21, 2024

Just going to procede with current project with addition of the 10 x 10 grid with names in the correct places.  

Could make an option just to list the players in order of the combos.  Having difficulty creating the grid for the final output.  

I think the randomized method of grabbing the combos is good.  May still be able to incorporate if the assignments are made
after the user enters all the names.  

Wondering if redux is better hooked up with a server than React state.

I got a static table rendered on the boxes page.  It uses basic html.  Not sure if this is a good model or not.  I would probably 
need to give each box it's own id.  There might be an automated way that uses less code, but that might take a long time to figure 
out.  It might be faster just to punch in all the html.  

The selected box should show the person's info somewhere on the screen and keep the box highlighted until another click is made.  The 
hover could cause a render of the person in real time, then stay on one person if clicked.  

FIgured out a way to map the entire table using React components.  Not sure how to get the correct name to the correct box.  This is taking 
awhile, and I'm not even sure that interactivity with the boxes will be possible.  Or too complicated.  May want to reevaluate the whole thing.
Not much progress today.  

If the box is fed the right person, it may not be complicatied to make on onhover or onclick to show the person's info.  Not sure about the other
way around though.  Focus on a chart that can be printed or emailed.

Fri, Feb 23, 2024

Kind of got the chart to work but there is a problem.  with multiple people in the same row, it generates another 10 collumns in the row.  
It also is not showing boxes for rows without anyone.  These may be related.  I dont thing the console.log double thing matters.  I'm 
prety sure the afcArray is correct.  

Kindof works.  Now it renders 100 squares but will not put multiple people in a row.  

Sat, Feb 24, 2024

Got the chart to work correctly.  Just had to modify the map function for the row array.  

The App is actually pretty self explanatory at this point.  Don't have labels for the chart.  Find way to print the chart as a jpg or pdf?
Maybe nest the table in a card?  I might do the hover thing first.  Make table into component.  THis will be good for rendering purposes.
