I initialized a react app using npx create-react-app nucampsite --template redux command.  I figured Redux will be useful down the 
line.  I installed the same dependancies as the 2024 nucampsite.  I am following that example to create this app.

The current plan is to first just render both the chart with the 100 boxes and a default set of names to pass in as data.
After that point, it should prompt the user with a form to enter new people and assign each person a random box until all the
boxes have been filled.  Also an option to view all of the entries and edit if desired.  

For now, it is framed as each person has an object with name, shortname, and email in addition to a randomly assigned combo
of AFC and NFC.  I'm not sure if this will change to simplify the process of entering info, and rendering to the chart.

The chart may either consist of 100 box components.  Components of 10 boxes forming a row.  10 row components.  Or if
there is some kind of chart component I can add.  This part will likely not be explained in nucampsite.  

Now I am just poking around and setting up a github repository.  

Make the Redux page a component that can be acessed for experimental purposes.  Replace the App return with a rendering of 
the default persons including all the info from their object.  probably need to push each person to an array of objects for React 
to iterate.  

Probably will use the react-router-dom to switch between pages.  Start with a list on one page.

Wed, Feb 7, 2024

I basically rendered the initial Redux page with a header above it with the text "Superbowl Boxes Pool".  I made the Redux return 
into it's own component and removed the <header> div.  Then modified App.js to include the new header with the ReduxInit component
beneath it.  Git commit "Redux Component".

I think the easy part is done.  Need to set up interactivity to add people to the list.  I'll just have a form on the front page.
Worry about styling later.  I guess first get the state redifined.  Just keep in mind that refresing the page will reset evertything.

I read through the default Redux Counter App.  Seems confusing.  Need to update the state of the persons array with a form input.
initialize with the dummies I created by default.  Add to the array grabbing a random combo without changing the numbers of the people
already on the list.  It's not going to change an array in javascript.  I'm not really sure how to do this with Redux.  I could probably 
use a push command on a js object, but that's not going to work with the React State Parameters.

The other thing is to figure out how to make the chart and display the shortnames based on the person's numbers.

I'd like to get to the point where I can enter an entry, one at a time.  Then view each entry and have a button next to it to edit.
Then some kind of modal to re enter the info.  And editing the person's info does not change the numbers.  So I guess each combo is 
randomly assigned, but does not change as people are added and edtited.  Or enter all one hundred names before assigning the combos.
That may be more desireable.  

Thurs, Feb 8, 2024

Set up a page router and a link.  If I put '/list' into the Chrome address bar, the numbers randomize.  I guess the randomBox script is
called again.  Also randomizes if I refresh the page.  If I use the link set up using the <Link> component, the numbers do not refresh.
I think at this point, the person objects are in the same state.  Note, using back and forward in the browser will reset the state if
the route was typed in directly, but will not if the link was used.  Was this the way in worked in Pizza Portfolio?

Not really sure how to do the styling on the list page.  I'd like them in the same box, but text justified to the left like it was before.

I removed the React import from App.js and it seems to work.  This import is not in App.js in i-heart-react or nucampsite 2024

Click on any name in the list, open a modal with the persons info, have an option to change the name, shortname, or email.  

I got it to justify the text as before.  If more pages are added, the App-header class can not surround everything.  I'll have to 
figure out the styling.  Seems not as easy as just bootstrap.  

Fri, Feb 9, 2024

Tried to make a form to input info.  Having difficulty installing react-redux-form in this project.  I may just have to continue 
and use formic or something.  I just want to enter a name, email, and shortname with validators.  then have the input change the state
by adding a new object to the persons array.  

Tues, Feb 13, 2024

Going to follow the new Nucamp project to add in a form that accepts the inputs I am looking for.  This submitted data needs to 
somehow be made into an object and assigned one of the combos.  Not sure about how this needs to be done in React.  I doubt the
JS I wrote will do all that.  

I used formik to make a small form to input information.  Having difficulty styling the input form to my desire.  Maybe worry about
that later?  

The styling issue was because I did not import Bootstrap in index.js.  The styling is decent enough.  Added validation to the formik
form.  

Need to select people from list and bring up a modal to edit info without changing the numbers.  First figure how to assign random 
combos and update the list as the user enters them in the form.  Then figure out the boxes page.  

Thurs, Feb 15, 2024

I used a state hook and put it in the parent component of the App.  I can now add names to the list, and have them rendered.  It seems
to take a random combination like it is supposed to.

Next I want to get it to invert the order of the list, and assign an id number to each person.  Then set up a link on each person's name 
that can be used to modify their info, without changine their number.  Also consider setting up the boxes on the next page.  

Animation to slide from one page to the next.  

It is working.  I'm not sure about consequenses of using the JS on the randomBox page.  Should the combos be a part of the React state?
All the inputed info is gone if the page refreshes.  Any way to make the system more cheat proof?  Could be an issue for some people.

I could release this online, just as a demonstration.

Error messages could include adding more than 100 people.  Also check for repeat names and emails.  

Could give the option to just enter names, names and short names, or names, shortnames, and email

Fri, Feb 16, 2024

I got the modal to display any person on the list that is clicked on.  I'd like to add a button to this to be able to edit the name and
email, without changing the numbers.  ANother thing to do is to check to verify that a name has not already been added.  Check for repeat 
emails, names, and shortnames.  If the randomBox works correctly, there should be no repeates.  THis may be a good time to try and make the boxes.
follow tick tack toe model?

Sat, Feb 17, 2024

Maybe an option to alphabetize the list of names, if that is possible.  Remove numbers and list alphabetically?  Index for map funciton 
will be backwards based on how the objects are defined.  

Sun, Feb 18, 2024

I got the edit modal to open upon pressing an 'Edit' button in the person card.  Passed values from an input form along with the id of the 
person being editted to the App component.  Need to get app to modify the person without changing the numbers or anyone else's information. 
Also want the edit form to have default entries of the current name, short name, and email.

Diffifulty moddifying the persons state and getting to work.  Looks like in changes the correct object, but somehting is thowing off the map funciton
after the change is made.  Can't really figure out.  Looking at React documentation.  could move on and come back to this feature later.  

May also want to make a remove option.  May want to come back to this later.  What's the best way to handle deletes?  Maybe you can't make
edits without ranomizing the whole thing

Monday, Feb 19, 2024

I had to use a function to copy the filtered object to be editted.  This way, i can manipulate the object without changing the properties in the 
persons array.  It worked, im just trying to only change the array using the change state function from React.  May want to modify the randomBox
thing so I don't have nested objects, and can use the spread operator to do what I want it to.  For now, it uses 

let personY = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(personZ))[0]

Could add a delete feature as well.  Not sure how that would work with combos.  May want to re sctructure the whole thing.  What if it randomizes 
every time an update is made?  That would make it hard to cheat.  Or a way to put in all the names, then randomly assign a square at the end.  
Probably want something to check for repeats on all the inputs.  

Can a map function do the same thing as the JSON.parse?  Idea is to copy the selected object without changing it.  Find a copy of nucampsite on
github?  Would like to have a copy of completed project.  Switch state control to Redux?  Maybe convert Pizza Portfolio.  useReducer hook?

Maybe use the simplified state control to make list app in React Native.

Tues, Feb 20, 2024

I updated the class component to leave this.both with an empty string.  Now I can use spread syntax to isolate the person to be editd from the 
methods changing the copy.  

Had the idea to basically have the user enter in all the names, review and verify that all the info is correct, then assign the random values to 
each person.  This would deter cheating by seeing a good number and slipping in someones name.  I guess for now I'll just make the boxes like I 
intended.  Need to construct boxes somehow anyway.  

Authentication and memory if the page accidentally gets refresed.  Maybe not scale to have users submit their own info.  That would be complicated.
But the one user could have the feature to save progress, and save the chart.  The chart should be interactive and printable.  

Add a footer?  Got routing for boxes page to work with button on list page.  animation from one page to the next.  

UX Put in all the names.  Once 100 is reached, prompt to be sure to go over all of the names and verify.  Can edit and delete at any point.  figuere 
out how to structure the delete.  Needs to shift id numbers around?  or the next person is assigned the missing number?  When 100 names are input, somehow
a button to view the boxes appears.  boxes should be interactive?  Maybe more important to just have an option to print it out.  or email.
This way, the submit and random assignments are done at the same time to discourage cheating.

Next level would be to actually email each person in the pool with their respective numbers.  Def not sure how to send out 100 emails based on user input.
Would send their numbers, the chart as a link, possibly an option to log into the pool and use the interactive chart to see where their friends and enemies 
are on the chart.  Separate first and last names?  May be a benefit in an alphabetical list.  

Wed, Feb 21, 2024

Just going to procede with current project with addition of the 10 x 10 grid with names in the correct places.  

Could make an option just to list the players in order of the combos.  Having difficulty creating the grid for the final output.  

I think the randomized method of grabbing the combos is good.  May still be able to incorporate if the assignments are made
after the user enters all the names.  

Wondering if redux is better hooked up with a server than React state.

Thurs, Feb 22, 2024

I got a static table rendered on the boxes page.  It uses basic html.  Not sure if this is a good model or not.  I would probably 
need to give each box it's own id.  There might be an automated way that uses less code, but that might take a long time to figure 
out.  It might be faster just to punch in all the html.  

The selected box should show the person's info somewhere on the screen and keep the box highlighted until another click is made.  The 
hover could cause a render of the person in real time, then stay on one person if clicked.  

FIgured out a way to map the entire table using React components.  Not sure how to get the correct name to the correct box.  This is taking 
awhile, and I'm not even sure that interactivity with the boxes will be possible.  Or too complicated.  May want to reevaluate the whole thing.
Not much progress today.  

If the box is fed the right person, it may not be complicatied to make on onhover or onclick to show the person's info.  Not sure about the other
way around though.  Focus on a chart that can be printed or emailed.

Fri, Feb 23, 2024

Kind of got the chart to work but there is a problem.  with multiple people in the same row, it generates another 10 collumns in the row.  
It also is not showing boxes for rows without anyone.  These may be related.  I dont thing the console.log double thing matters.  I'm 
prety sure the afcArray is correct.  

Kindof works.  Now it renders 100 squares but will not put multiple people in a row.  

Sat, Feb 24, 2024

Got the chart to work correctly.  Just had to modify the map function for the row array.  

The App is actually pretty self explanatory at this point.  Don't have labels for the chart.  Find way to print the chart as a jpg or pdf?
Maybe nest the table in a card?  I might do the hover thing first.  Make table into component.  THis will be good for rendering purposes.

App still works even after shutting down running domain.  Refreshing the page shuts it down.  

Sun, Feb 25, 2024

Tyring to get the hover thing to work for the Table.  Should show a persons info somewhere on the page when the pointer hovers over.  When clicked,
either open a modal with their info, or just freeze the display.  Also want the chart to be labelled.

I think a state cotrolled in a parent has to pass functions through the children to be changed.  I'm pretty sure that it is one of the benefits of
Redux.  The state can be manipulated remotely from any componenet.  

I guess for demonstration purposes, fill fill in 95 default people so that the user can reach 100.  This shows how it works while also implementing
a loop that will not allow repeats.  

I got the info to render to the right of the chart when mouse hovers over any given box.  Want to be able to freeze this data if the person clicks, 
or somehting.  Not sure about best way to do this.  Maybe a button to enable hover until a box is clicked on.  Need to style the personCardNM a little 
better.  Consider updateing to use React Col and Row compoenents as opposed to using divs.  The whole app could be styled better.  Position card so it
moves with the page?

It's not like you can reeasign numbers.  Could switch names around i guess.  Be kind of difficult.  

Positioning of chart and display card is a little wacky when changing the screen size.  Lots of margin when it stacks.  Which view ports are most important?
right now, it looks the best on the laptop screen.

Hover works until clicked.  a button then shows up to unfreeze to allow hovering to work after the button is clicked.  

Monday, February 26, 2024

I  enabled the chart to render just one person to the card if a person is clicked on.  This dissables the hover and allows one person to be 
clicked on to change the state.  I also added an unfreeze button that reenables the hover that the page intitiates with.  The button does not
appear when the state is set to hover.  

Works best on the laptop screen.  I like the interactivity.  It would be nice if everyone participating in the pool had access to this page.

Maybe the next thing is to find a way to not accidentally add the same person twice.  May modify the renderlist to not show the numbers.
Wondering about accidentally adding the same person twice and ways that the user could cheat.  Maybe a delete option as well.  In the editting 
modal, I'd like the existing info to be prefilled in the input feilds.  

It's occuring to me that using the back button in the browser will reset the state?  I guess only in certain situations.

Should I try to use Redux for this?  I could update Pizza Portfolio to use function components and the new Redux tools.
Propbably just compeltely start over w/ Pizza.  Leave the old one, make a new one for the hell of it.  Want to deploy 
this app to google?  Think I'd rather deploy coffee, just to see how much it takes to do.  

Tues, Feb 27, 2024

I'll try to get the edditing default feilds to work.  That wasn't as hard as I thought.  

Maybe now check for repeats?  Where have I seen this done?  Bootstrap workshop 5.  Needs to iterate for repeats and stop before sending to change the
state.  Probably want to do this for both adding names, and making edits.  Start with adding duplicate names.  This doesn't make the user experience more
complicated if done correctly.   As long as the state variables are not mutated, I think all JS if fair game.  Got the name to work, need to figure out how
to alert the user.  

Got a Reactstrap warning to show if the user attempts a repeat name.  It also does not add the person to the list.  The error message is hard coded.  
This should change based on which feild had a repeat.  There are probably a few ways to do this.  I could just leave the hard coded message.  
Got it to make a custom message for a repeat in any of the feilds.  Seems to work as intended.  May want to implement the same test for person edit.
I'm just going to leave the edit for now.  

Based on the current square size, 6 digits is the limit for characters in the short name wihout streching the grid.  if a space is used, however,
two lines of text show in the box, and it works.  Not sure what to do here.  Easy thing is to just shorten the validator to 6.  May need to toy with
rendering, or make the boxes bigger.  

How to get the chart labeled and make to a format that can be printed?

Formatting is bad.  Especially for small viewports.  Media quary to change the distance between the chart and the card when collumns collapse.  
The shortName thing with the space may be difficult.  

May want to set up a server and authentication to store the state of the app.  This way, if it is accidentally shut down, person can
pick up where he left off.  How do I create a server separate from Nucampsite?  I just need one directory for persons..

Wed, Feb 28, 2024

I could try to imbed the chart on a card?  I don't know much about positiong and styling.  How to make a link to make the chart printable.  
The card thing is not working well.  I may try to figure out html or jsx labels.  

Get the person card to move with the page on Boxes page.  

I abandoned the card.  integrated an NFC label pretty easily.  The AFC boxes are harder to add to because each box in each row is part of a map
function.  I could try to get it to do what I want using the map function, or figure out how to better conjoin a separate AFC lable that sticks
with the left side of the chart.  Is there a way to just hard code another column before the chart?  Can the vertical cells be merged like the 
horizontal ones?  How can I save the chart saved as a pdf? 

Thurs, Feb 29, 2024

Seeing about putting in another column to label the vertical axis.  Used three massive if statements just to get the Chart to render 'AFC' on 
the side.  I doubt I can get the cells to merge, so it looks kind of bad.

I got the cells containing 'AFC' to merge, but not the others.  It's kind of a lot of code to just do what it does.  I wonder if I could make
a loop or something to make it less sloppy.  Right now there are three if statements containing a return for the Row input.  It's nice having 
the axis lables built into the chart.  

Now there's just one conditional for row 0.  This merges the entire collumn.  

Can set up a server with a login?  User can log in and access a partially made pool, and continue where he left off.  Maybe also an option to
delete persons and restart the whole thing.  Should make a branch for this?  Maybe not, I could just checkout to earlier version if needed. 
Figure out how to allow enter up to 13 digits with a space, but neither word longer than 6 digits.   

Friday, March 1, 2024

I'm looking at action creators on the original React Nucampsite.  Could configure it to use a fake server and use fetch to save the entries.
Ideally, a user can log in and return to his particular save point.  Put in some names and return later to edit and view the chart.
Authentication does not seem to be covered here.  Could for now just have the inputs posted on a json server.  Worry about authenticaiton later.
I'm pretty sure I can set this up without using Redux, but I'm not really sure. 

Saturday, March 2, 2024

Not sure what would happen if someone were to clone an app that uses a json server.  Can the server be pushed to GitHub as well.  The reason 
is that I'd like to show off the functionality of the app to anyone who acesses it on GitHub.  

Ideally, the App functions as it does now without the server running.  But saves the progress if the server is turned on.  Not sure if there
is a way to do this.  I guess server interactivity is another level of complexity.  

There's a way to install json-server locally.  Not sure if this matters or not.  I'm just trying to find a way to make the server acessible
to anyone cloning the boxes repository.  I wonder why Nucamp didn't put the server in the React Repository.  Maybe because it is used for 
React Native as well?  I guess this research counts as project time.  Still not sure whether or not i need to set up Redux.  What is the 
reasoning to Redux if a backend is in place?

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/json-server-for-frontend-development/

Want a user to be able to sign in and have access to their specific pool information.  Adding interacivity and the ability to print out the
chart is critical.  Those and the shortName thing.  

Think I can setup a json server wherever.  Can a json server be pushed to GitHub.  

Following tutorial.  Confused about typescript vs Javascript.  I'll need to get this to work in JS.  Difference between hook and function?
DIfference between useState and useEffect?  I think the interface and colons and <> brackets are typescript.

Are useFetch return variables in constant updating state?  So the loading shows until the data is returned?  Need to decide if I want to
do the tuturial or just dive in with my own app.  It's frusturating bc I'm not familiar with typescpript and it only demonstrates read operations.
I would need to figure out the other three as well to get up and running.  Look into adding db.json to a git repository.  Is this easy to do?
Would it be easy to set up the App and Server using clone?  

I can set up a json server wherever.  I assume the file can be loaded to github.  The user would just need to use the right port when running the
App.  

I think the useEffect block reiterates when any given promise is fulfilled.  That way the loading and errors are current on the page render.  

May want to finish up React Course before proceding.  Could do this tutorial in the mean time?  Maybe do the tutorial without typescript to see
if I can get it to work.  

Sunday, Mar 3, 2024

Does the cloner need to have json server installed for a project to run?

Maybe set up using a json server now and try to hook up to the back end of the course later.  

Use effect is interaction with the server in the tutorial.  Interpreting to JS seems difficult.  Can update app to be able to add a new name
to the list?  I guess I could enable server GET requests for now and add post, put, delete later on.  Still not sure if I should bother with 
Redux or not.  In theory, the APP could be used by a large volume of users, each with their own persons data.  Maybe I will set up redux.

I'm wondering if the App could have default functionality when no user is logged in.  Then be able to save the data for someone who is.  

May want to take some time to reorgonize the components in this app.

I have a feeling the hard coded combos will bite me at some point.  May need to modify some things.  If a user is logged in, the combos 
need to be kept track of.  Reseting the combos will cause problems.  Functionality is preliminary.

Monday, Mar 3, 2024

The six letter limit thing can be done with regex?

Maybe load intitial persons from a server and work my way up?  Not sure whether or not to use redux.
The combos would need to be in the database as well.  I guess intitially set it up for just one user.
essentially give the app memory to load to and from.  Maybe don't use the class for the time being.  
Just get it to read the default data.  Would I put the combos in a useEffect block?  If you hard code people
in, it needs to take the appropriate combos and save the remaining ones.  

Get this online for one admin validation.  Just for me to show that it works. I guess if it was cloned, 
the db would be cloned with it.  The json.server would need to be run somehow to acccess the data.  I could
put it online as is, with the state resetting every time it is loaded.  Just to get a thing online.  Ultimitely, 
server functionality would be good.  

May want to do a git branch here?  

May need to restructure combos as objects so that the json server will work.  db needs to be in json format.  

Tues, Mar 5, 2024

I can always make a brach later, or just checkout if need be.  

The concat and edit will likely be replaced with calls to the json server.  I'd like to find a way to render the persons array.  I can just manually
enter the data.  It would be nice to figure that out though.  json.stringify?
