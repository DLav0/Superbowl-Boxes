An App to simplify the process of creating a typical betting pool that people create for the Superbowl.  Each person is given 
a "box" in a 10 x 10 chart.  The horizontal index determines the point value of the last digit in the score of the NFC team, while the vertical 
index determines the point value of the last digit of the AFC team at the end of the quarter.  The person who alligns with both wins the pool.  

It's typically done for every quarter, but for now, I'm just creating one chart.  Focus is to make it easy to punch in names and 
return the chart in a printable format.  

Other ideas are to have the participants submit their information to the app.  Also, a way to email each person in the pool with
their numbers and a copy of the chart to print out.
